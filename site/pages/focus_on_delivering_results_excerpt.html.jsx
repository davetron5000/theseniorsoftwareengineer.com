        <div className="sectionbody">
        <div className="paragraph"><p>A senior software engineer is trusted and expected to do
          the most important work and to do it reliably.  The way to
          accomplish that is to focus everything you do on the delivery of <em>results</em>.</p></div>
        <div className="paragraph"><p>At a previous job, I was responsible for the purchasing and refund logic
          of a large e-commerce website.  One day, Mary (one of our
          customer service representatives) emailed me with a problem.
          Mary was attempting to refund a customer but the system wouldn&#8217;t let her, instead
          giving her a cryptic error message.</p></div>
        <div className="paragraph"><p>I didn&#8217;t immediately know what was wrong, so I was about to write her back with the
          message &#8220;I&#8217;ll look into it&#8221;, but I stopped. What value would Mary
          get out of such an email? What purpose would it serve to send her
          a promise, but no real answer? I decided that she deserved exactly
          one response from me: an email with a definitive answer in it.</p></div>
        <div className="paragraph"><p>I did some research and realized that a constraint of our credit card
          processor was preventing the type of refund she was attempting.  She would have
          to wait 24 hours from the time of purchase for the refund to go through.</p></div>
        <div className="paragraph"><p>I made a small change to detect this special case and show a more helpful error message.
          I deployed the change and wrote Mary back with my findings. I explained
          that, while there was no way to avoid the 24 hour waiting period, she would
          at least get a more instructive error message in the future.</p></div>
        <div className="paragraph"><p>She sent me a problem and I replied with a solution.</p></div>
        <div className="paragraph"><p>After this, I began to approach <em>every</em> task this way.  Instead
          of making promises or publicizing plans, I resolved to focus
          on delivering results - and results only - as much as I possibly could.  I wanted
          everything that I produced to be a definitive answer or working code or both.</p></div>
        <div className="paragraph"><p>You must make this change as well.  By focusing on the delivery
          of results, you will become more reliable and your work product
          will be of much higher value to the company (or yourself).</p></div>
        <div className="paragraph"><p>You might think that the phrase &#8220;focus on delivering results&#8221; is a simple sound-bite or that you
          already take a &#8220;results-oriented&#8221; approach.  I used to think this too, but the <em>results</em> and
        <em>focus</em> I&#8217;m talking about are more specific, more literal.  Let&#8217;s first understand
          these two terms and then see how this will change the way we work.</p></div>
        <div className="sect2">
        <h3 id="_results">Results</h3>
        <div className="paragraph"><p>On any reasonably-sized software project, there are a lot
          of <em>deliverables</em> however few of these are what I would call a <em>result</em>.
            Most teams have some sort of project manager whose function is to keep
            the team moving, often by facilitating a process for development.
            To do this, a good project manager will use various tools and techniques
            such as project plans, estimates, and delivery schedules.</p></div>
        <div className="paragraph"><p>While these are useful, they are fundamentally different from
          working software and it&#8217;s important that you and your team understand
          the difference.  Your company&#8217;s customers don&#8217;t pay for project
          roadmaps.  Users cannot get their work done with a project schedule
          or burn-down chart.  Working, shipped software is what pays the bills
          and solves users' problems.</p></div>
        <div className="paragraph"><p>Of course, shipped code isn&#8217;t necessarily a result.  A result from shipped code is one that causes
          a positive change in how the business works.  Code that doesn&#8217;t have a measurable
          impact on the application it&#8217;s a part of is not nearly as important as code that does.</p></div>
        <div className="paragraph"><p>Results are more than just working software, however.  As my anecdote
          above demonstrates, sometimes a result is as simple as a definitive answer
          to a question.  An explanation about how something works is
          supremely useful, whereas an email that you&#8217;ll &#8220;look into it&#8221; is not.</p></div>
        <div className="paragraph"><p>A <em>result</em> then, is an artifact of direct business value.  Working
          code, documentation, and definitive statements are all results.
          Anything else must be understood as fundamentally different.</p></div>
        <div className="paragraph"><p>This isn&#8217;t to say that project schedules, status reports, and other
          similar &#8220;deliverables&#8221; have no value. You just need to treat
          them as a <em>means</em> to an end, not an end unto themselves.  If you
            start treating <em>progress</em> toward a goal as being just as acceptable as actually
        <em>achieving</em> said goal, you or your team will lose focus and momentum, and be less and less
          valuable to the company over time.</p></div>
        <div className="paragraph"><p>Now that we understand what a result is, let&#8217;s talk about what it means
          to truly <em>focus</em> on its delivery.</p></div>
