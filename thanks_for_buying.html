<img alt="photo of the author" class="mb2 mw1 rc" src="/images/me.jpg">
<span class="tc f3 db mb2">I'm Dave Copeland, a programmer and author.</span>I've written several books, including <a href="https://sidekiqrails.com">Ruby on Rails Background Jobs with Sidekiq</a>, <a href="https://sustainable-rails.com">Sustainable Web Development with Ruby on Rails</a>, and was a co-author of <a href="http://bit.ly/dcrails6">Agile Web Deveoppment With Rails</a>. I have over 26 years of professional development experience as a developer, manager, CTO, and architect. I was most recently CTO of healthcare startup Mood Health. Before that I spent six years at Stitch Fix as Chief Software Architect, helping build the team from 3 to over 200 engineers, from startup to IPO and beyond. I previously worked on high-performance, high-traffic systems at LivingSocial and helped build the team at Opower before that. I've also worked consulting and government gigs.</p>
<p>I go by “Dave”, but write books under my full name (“David Bryant Copeland”) because, as it turns out, my name is pretty common :).</p>
<p class="f4">I live in Washington, DC with my lovely wife.</p>
